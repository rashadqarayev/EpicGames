        text2:"You can free climb, glide, sail, and swim your way through the tropical paradise, but there’s a lot more to it than that. Tchia also features the ability to “soul jump”, inhabiting animals and inanimate objects to move around and solve puzzles. And did I mention that the game features a fully playable ukulele?   To find out a bit more about the game, which hits early next year, we chatted with Phil Crifo, game director at developer Awaceb, about how his New Caledonia childhood and personal journey helped shape Tchia and what players can expect from the title when it hits.",
        img2:nostalgia2,
        img3class:"img-fluid mb-5",
        text3:"The game is clearly shaped by New Caledonia. What drove your decision to focus on the island and how that shaped the game's early development?",
        text4:'Crifo: When you are born and have lived your whole youth on a remote island, you usually end up hating the place at some point When I turned 18, the only thing on my mind was leaving New Caledonia for Europe to experience something different, bigger. Then a few years later, you realize that this setting for a childhood was actually pretty special! I think getting away from the island for a bunch of years definitely helped me take a step back and build a new, different appreciation for it. Add childhood nostalgia to that and you build a cocktail of inspiration and stories to tell. For me this arrived right when we started brainstorming our next project, around 2018, and it just felt right. New Caledonia is in our DNA and has shaped who we are, it has incredibly rich cultures, landscapes, folklore that are pretty much unseen in any media. It felt fresh, real, and authentic, and it felt like the type of project we wanted to build Awaceb around. That decision was pivotal for the game, because every artistic and design decision we made from then had to be thought out through the prism of that cultural inspiration. Far from a constraint, this proved to be an incredible framework to build on, because for every challenge and question, we had real, tangible things to look at as reference and inspiration.',
        img3:nostalgia3,
        text6:"What is it you hope to achieve with Tchia?",
        text7:"Crifo: I know New Caledonia gets mentioned a lot, and rightfully so, but I hope it doesn't overshadow the fact that we are making a cool game first and foremost. From the start, we decided to make a game and to tell a story that is universal and can be enjoyed by anyone around the world, regardless of if they are familiar with NC or not. That was very important and it has been a fine line to walk between honoring our cultural inspirations and creating a product with a broad appeal, but I'm very confident we succeeded to find that sweet spot (this is the reason why the world of Tchia is entirely fictional and doesn't use real names, topography, and such). If Tchia strikes an interest for NC in some players, that would be amazing, but first and foremost I simply hope people will have a good time and that the story, themes and gameplay will resonate with players.",
